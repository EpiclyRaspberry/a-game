1
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,120
rise and shine mr freeman

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,800
rise and

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,120
shine

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,920
not that i wish to imply you have been

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,320
sleeping on the job

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,920
no one is more deserving of a rest and

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,560
all the effort in the world would have

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,840
gone to waste

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,519
until well

10
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,719
let's just say your hour has come again

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,879
the right man in the wrong place can

12
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,360
make all the difference in the world

13
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,960
so wake up

14
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,440
mr freeman

15
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,640
wake up and

16
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,280
smell the ashes

17
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,439
you
